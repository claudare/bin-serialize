# bin-serailize

A zig serailization library which allows for simple automatic and custom serialization to readers/writers. Currently, the encoding is not super efficient or performant. Will improve in the future.

The following types are currently supported/planned:

- [x] Bool
- [ ] Float
- [ ] Int
- [ ] Optional
- [ ] Enum
- [ ] Union
- [ ] Struct
- [ ] StructPacked
- [ ] Array
- [ ] Slice
- [ ] String
- [ ] PointerSingle
- [ ] ArrayList
- [ ] ArrayListUnmanaged
- [ ] HashMap
- [ ] HashMapUnmanaged
